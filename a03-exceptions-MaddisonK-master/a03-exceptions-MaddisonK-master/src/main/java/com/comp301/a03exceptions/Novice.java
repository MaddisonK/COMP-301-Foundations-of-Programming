  /**
   * Section 1: Throwing exceptions
   *
   * <p>Upon execution, this method should throw a specific subclass of RuntimeException. Which
   * subclass to throw depends on the value of input parameter n.
   *
   * <p>If n is negative, throw the RuntimeException subclass which is used to indicate that a
   * required operation is not supported.
   *
   * <p>If n is zero, throw the RuntimeException subclass which is used to indicate that an index is
   * invalid.
   *
   * <p>If n is one, throw the RuntimeException subclass which is used to indicate that an array
   * index is invalid.
   *
   * <p>If n is two, throw the RuntimeException subclass which is used to indicate that an invalid
   * state was detected in the application.
   *
   * <p>If n is three, throw the RuntimeException subclass which is used to indicate that an invalid
   * argument value was provided to the method.
   *
   * <p>If n is four, throw the RuntimeException subclass which is used to indicate that an
   * arithmetic error occurred during execution of the method.
   *
   * <p>If n is any multiple of five, throw the RuntimeException subclass which is used to indicate
   * that an illegal operation was performed on a null reference. Pass a message string to the
   * exception's constructor, with the message "The value of n is [insert value of n here]". For
   * example, if n is 15 (which is a multiple of five), the exception message should be "The value
   * of n is 15".
   *
   * <p>If n is none of these values, simply return n.

   * <p>This method should call method section1(), pass in the argument n as the parameter, and

   * block, and use it to catch the exceptions specifically associated with n values of three, four,
   * and five. Don't catch any of the other exceptions that section1() might throw.
   *
   * <p>If the exception associated with an n value of three is caught, this method should instead
   * throw the exception associated with an n value of four. If the n=4 exception is caught, you
   * should instead throw the n=5 exception. And if the n=5 exception is caught, you should return
   * -1.
