# a07-pizza

In this assignment, you'll use the creational design patterns *singleton*, *multiton*, and *factory method* to control instantiation of some classes.

Imagine the process of ordering a pizza at a local pizza shop. What information does a customer need to provide so that they get the pizza they want?

1. What **size** should the pizza be?
2. What kind of **crust** should the pizza have?
3. What kind of **cheese** should be used?
4. What kind of **sauce** should be used?
5. What **toppings** should go on the pizza?

This assignment revolves around designing a series of classes that model the process of ordering pizza. In novice, you'll create classes to represent the ingredients that go in a pizza. In adept, you'll create a class to represent a pizza. And in jedi, you'll create factory methods which are responsible for creating different pizza objects.

## Novice

Let's start by designing some classes to model pizza ingredients.

### IngredientImpl

Check out the `Ingredient` interface. An ingredient is an object that encapsulates the following information:

1. The name of the ingredient, which is a string value.
2. A boolean value representing whether the ingredient is vegetarian or not.
3. A boolean value representing whether the ingredient is vegan or not.

Make a new class, `IngredientImpl`, which implements the `Ingredient` interface and encapsulates the above information. The `IngredientImpl` class should be immutable. Add a suitable constructor to initialize the encapsulated fields using initial values passed in as parameter values.

> Note: The order or type of the constructor's parameters don't matter to the autograder

Next, we're going to create special subclasses of `IngredientImpl` to represent four different categories of pizza ingredients: crust, sauce, cheese, and toppings.

### Crust

Create a new subclass of `IngredientImpl`, called `Crust`. This new class will use a variant of the multiton design pattern, so give it a `private` constructor.

Now let's create and store a few `Crust` instances inside the `Crust` class. The instances we create will represent the different types of pizza crust that are available at the pizza shop. The pizza shop offers customers their choice of three types of crust:

| name        | is vegetarian? | is vegan? | field name  |
|-------------|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| hand-tossed | yes            | yes       | HAND_TOSSED |
| thin        | yes            | yes       | THIN        |
| deep dish   | yes            | yes       | DEEP_DISH   |

Using the field names and data values listed above, add three `public static final` fields to the `Crust` class. These fields will store references to the three types of crust offered by the pizza shop. For example, one of the field declarations *might* look like this:

```java
public static final Crust HAND_TOSSED = new Crust("hand-tossed", true, true);
```

> Note: Your `Crust` constructor arguments might be different, depending on how you wrote the constructor

In accordance with the singleton and multiton design patterns, we would traditionally mark the `HAND_TOSSED`, `THIN`, and `DEEP_DISH` fields `private`, and expose them through a `static` factory method. However, since `Crust` instances are immutable, and the fields in question are `final`, it's okay to expose them directly as constant values by simply assigning them the `public` access modifier.


### Sauce

Add another subclass of `IngredientImpl`, called `Sauce`. This new class will be similar to `Crust`, except it represents the pizza sauce choices offered by the pizza shop.

Make the constructor of `Sauce` private, and include `public static final Sauce` fields for the following sauce options:

| name        | is vegetarian? | is vegan? | field name  |
|-------------|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| tomato      | yes            | yes       | TOMATO      |
| barbecue    | yes            | yes       | BARBECUE    |
| pesto       | yes            | yes       | PESTO       |
| alfredo     | yes            | no        | ALFREDO     |
| ranch       | yes            | no        | RANCH       |


### Cheese

Add another subclass of `IngredientImpl`, called `Cheese`. This new class will be similar to `Crust` and `Sauce`, except it represents the pizza cheese choices offered by the pizza shop.

Make the constructor of `Cheese` private, and include `public static final Cheese` fields for the following cheese options:

| name        | is vegetarian? | is vegan? | field name  |
|-------------|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| mozzarella  | yes            | no        | MOZZARELLA  |
| blend       | yes            | no        | BLEND       |
| vegan       | yes            | yes       | VEGAN       |


### Topping

Finally, add one more subclass of `IngredientImpl`, called `Topping`. This new class will be similar to `Crust`, `Sauce`, and `Cheese`, except it represents the pizza topping choices offered by the pizza shop.

Make the constructor of `Topping` private, and include `public static final Topping` fields for the following toppings:

| name             | is vegetarian? | is vegan? | field name       |
|------------------|----------------|-----------|------------------|
| tomato           | yes            | yes       | TOMATO           |
| garlic           | yes            | yes       | GARLIC           |
| mushrooms        | yes            | yes       | MUSHROOMS        |
| pineapple        | yes            | yes       | PINEAPPLE        |
| olives           | yes            | yes       | OLIVES           |
| green pepper     | yes            | yes       | GREEN_PEPPER     |
| spinach          | yes            | yes       | SPINACH          |
| onion            | yes            | yes       | ONION            |
| jalapeno         | yes            | yes       | JALAPENO         |
| sun-dried tomato | yes            | yes       | SUN_DRIED_TOMATO |
| pepperoni        | no             | no        | PEPPERONI        |
| ground beef      | no             | no        | GROUND_BEEF      |
| sausage          | no             | no        | SAUSAGE          |
| bacon            | no             | no        | BACON            |
| buffalo chicken  | no             | no        | BUFFALO_CHICKEN  |
| ham              | no             | no        | HAM              |
| anchovies        | no             | no        | ANCHOVIES        |


## Adept

Now it's time to create a class to represent a pizza.

## PizzaImpl

Start by taking a look at the `Pizza` interface. A pizza is an object that encapsulates the following information:

1. The size of the pizza (either small, medium, or large), represented by a `Size` enum field
2. The type of crust on the pizza, represented by a `Crust` instance
3. The type of sauce on the pizza, represented by a `Sauce` instance
4. The type of cheese on the pizza, represented by a `Cheese` instance
5. The toppings on the pizza, represented by a `Topping` list or array

Make a new class, `PizzaImpl`, which implements the `Pizza` interface and encapsulates the above information. The `PizzaImpl` class should be immutable. Add a suitable constructor to initialize the encapsulated fields using initial values passed in as parameter values.

> Note: The order or type of the constructor's parameters don't matter to the autograder

Most of the `Pizza` methods should be self-explanatory in terms of implementation. One exception, however, is `getPrice()`. The `getPrice()` method should be a derived getter which calculates and returns the price of the pizza as a `double` value based on the pizza size and number of toppings.

If the pizza is **small**, its price should be $7.00 plus $0.25 per topping. If it is **medium**, its price should be $9.00 plus $0.50 per topping. If it is **large**, its price should be $11.00 plus $0.75 per topping.

## Jedi

The last step of the assignment is to write a series of `static` factory methods which will instantiate special types of pizza.

Add a new class, `PizzaFactory`, to your project. `PizzaFactory` will contain the factory methods that handle pizza instantiation.

inside the `PizzaFactory` class, add the following factory methods.

### Cheese pizza

Add a factory method to the `PizzaFactory` class to instantiate a cheese pizza. The factory method should have the following signature:

```java
public static Pizza makeCheesePizza(Size size) {
  // Your code here
}
```

Here, `Size` refers to the `enum` defined in the `Pizza` interface. You may need to import `Pizza.Size` to avoid a compile-time error, but IntelliJ should help with this.

The factory method should create and return a new `Pizza` instance with hand-tossed crust, tomato sauce, cheese blend, and no toppings. The returned `Pizza` object should also have the correct size as specified by the method's parameter.


### Hawaiian pizza

Add a factory method to the `PizzaFactory` class to instantiate a Hawaiian pizza. The factory method should have the following signature:

```java
public static Pizza makeHawaiianPizza(Size size) {
  // Your code here
}
```

The factory method should create and return a new `Pizza` instance with hand-tossed crust, tomato sauce, cheese blend, and two toppings: ham and pineapple. The returned `Pizza` object should also have the correct size as specified by the method's parameter.


### Meat lover's pizza

Add a factory method to the `PizzaFactory` class to instantiate a meat lover's pizza. The factory method should have the following signature:

```java
public static Pizza makeMeatLoversPizza(Size size) {
  // Your code here
}
```

The factory method should create and return a new `Pizza` instance with deep-dish crust, tomato sauce, cheese blend, and four toppings: pepperoni, sausage, bacon, and ground beef. The returned `Pizza` object should also have the correct size as specified by the method's parameter.


### Veggie supreme pizza

Add a factory method to the `PizzaFactory` class to instantiate a veggie supreme pizza. The factory method should have the following signature:

```java
public static Pizza makeVeggieSupremePizza(Size size) {
  // Your code here
}
```

The factory method should create and return a new `Pizza` instance with thin crust, tomato sauce, cheese blend, and four toppings: sun-dried tomato, green peppers, mushrooms, and olives. The returned `Pizza` object should also have the correct size as specified by the method's parameter.


### Daily special pizza

Finally, add one more factory method to the `PizzaFactory` class to instantiate a daily special pizza. The factory method should have the following signature:

```java
public static Pizza makeDailySpecialPizza() {
  // Your code here
}
```

The factory method should create and return a new `Pizza` instance, but this time you get to choose what type of pizza to create. Instantiate and return your favorite type of pizza! Notice that this time, there is no `size` parameter; this is because you get to choose what size to return.
